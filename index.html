                        I am a computer science honours graduate from the University of Saskatchewan. My interest in programming began when I was very young, and I have pursued it in both high school and university. I pride myself on my ability to work with others, and solve problems without large amounts of instruction.<br><br>
    In university my goal was to gain the widest breath of knowledge within Computer Science that I could. So I ended up taking classes on a wide variety of topics including: operating system design, concurrent programming, image processesing, databases, web programming, artificial intelligence, algorithm design, and many more topics (as can be seen on my résumé). I enjoy all of the areas of computer science that I have studied so far, and I am eager to learn more!<br><br>
    Aside from computer science I am also very interested in physics. I have taken multiple physics classes as electives, and I would take more if I could. If I am not studying something computer science related, than I am most likely trying to expand my knowledge on various physics topics.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        OS432 is a simple operating system that me and a team of 5 other people made for our advanced operating systems concepts class (CMPT 432). The operating system was designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, and allowed the user to choose from a list of pre-defined processes to run. These processes showed that we were able to achieve user level processes, interprocess communication, and basic keyboard & screen I/O. This project gave me a solid understanding of modern operating systems, as well as the arm architecture and assembly language.

                        The website that you are currently on was made by me and is hosted on Github Pages. The website was written using basic HTML, Javascript, CSS, jQuery, and the Bootstrap front-end framework. The intention of this website is to describe myself and the work that I've done so far. As time goes on I plan to post more of my personal projects on here and continue to make improvements to the site. This site is mainly for fun, and so that I can stay up to date with the latest web programming tools and languages.

                    <h3>Sketchem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sketchem is a game that me and one other person made for our web programming class (CMPT 350). This game was made using HTML 5, CSS, Javascript , and Node JS. It would automatically assign a user a word to draw, and all other users had to try to guess the word that the user was drawing. We wrote the server from scratch using Node JS and web sockets. The server worked by passing drawing coordinates between all users, then the lines were computed, connected, and displayed on the client side.
