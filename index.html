        <p>
          I am currently a 4th year computer science honours student at the University of Saskatchewan. My interest
          in programming began when I was very young, and I have pursued it in both high school and now university.
          I pride myself on my ability to work with / learn from others, and solve problems without large amounts of
          instruction.<br><br>
          Aside from computer science I am also very interested in physics and astronomy. I have taken multiple physics
          classes as electives, and I would take more if I could. If I am not studying something computer science related,
          then I am most likely keeping up-to-date with these two other subjects.<br><br>
          Other than school and studying I enjoy playing sports with my friends, learning new instruments, 
          and listening to music.

          <h2>OS432</h2>
    OS432 is a simple operating system that me and a team of 5 other people made for our
          advanced operating systems concepts class (CMPT 432). The operating system was designed
          to run on a Raspberry Pi, and allowed the user to choose from a list of pre-defined
          processes to run. These processes showed that we were able to achieve user level processes,
          interprocess communication, and keyboard / screen I/O. This project gave me a solid understanding
          of modern operating systems, as well as the arm architecture / assembly language.

          <h2>Doodle Charades</h2>
          Doodle Charades is a game that me and one other person made for our web programming class (CMPT 350).
          This game was made using HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, and Node JS. It would automatically assign a
          user a word to draw, and all other users had to try to guess the word that the user was drawing.
          We wrote the server from scratch using Node JS and web sockets. The server worked by passing drawing
          coordinates between all users, then the lines were computed, connected, and displayed on the client side.
