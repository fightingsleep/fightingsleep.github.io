        </div>
        I am currently a 4th year computer science honours student at the University of Saskatchewan. My interest
        in programming began when I was very young, and I have pursued it in both high school and now university.
        I pride myself on my ability to work with others, and solve problems without large amounts of
        instruction.<br><br>
        In university my goal was to gain the widest breath of knowledge within Computer Science that I could. So I ended
        up taking classes on a wide variety of topics including: operating system design, concurrent programming, image processesing,
        databases, web programming, artificial intelligence, algorithm design, and many more topics (as can be seen on my resume).
        I enjoy all of the areas of computer science that I have studied so far, and I am eager to learn more!<br><br>
        Aside from computer science I am also very interested in physics. I have taken multiple physics
        classes as electives, and I would take more if I could. If I am not studying something computer science related,
        than I am most likely trying to expand my knowledge on various physics topics.<br><br>
        Other than school and studying I enjoy playing sports with my friends, learning new instruments, 
        and listening to music.<br><br>
